## 👪 Contributing

If you plan to submit a PR bigger than a simple change in one file, here is a short intro about how to do a clean PR. **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request.
You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project locally via git clone `https://github.com/itCarl/ReflowPlate.git` (replacing `itCarl` with your GitHub Username) and work on your local copy
2. Add the upstream repository via git remote add upstream `https://github.com/itCarl/ReflowPlate.git`
3. Ensure you are on the master branch via `git checkout master`
4. Create your Feature Branch by running `git checkout -b <temp_branch>`
5. Set the upstream branch via `git push --set-upstream origin <temp_branch>`
6. Work on your local and push as many commits as you want

#### When you think it is ready to merge and submit a PR:

1. Return to the master branch via `git checkout master`
2. Ensure your master branch is up-to-date with the latest changes via `git pull upstream master`
3. Update your fork of this repo by running `git push`
4. Create a new branch to be used for your PR via `git checkout -b <pr_branch>`
5. Set the upstream branch via `git push --set-upstream origin <pr_branch>`
6. Merge the edits but be sure to remove the history of your local commits via `git merge --squash <temp_branch> `
7. Create a new commit containing all of your merged changes via `git commit -m "<Message>"`

##### Now you have a clean single commit from which you can create the PR on Github.
